# Contribute

Thanks for wanting to help in this incredible project, this is how you can:
## Add descriptions

If some page didn't have a description, feel free to edit that and add one.

**This is only for first pages, when it wasn't required the description.**

If you add new page, it **must have a description** or it will be removed.
## Add new pages

If you know some underrated websites, you can edit the [readme](./README.md) and add it in the correct order, at the end of the other listed pages.

This is what you should do:
- `Star this repo :)`
- Fork this repo
- In your forked repo, add new branch
- In your new branch, make your changes
- Commit them to this branch with a meaningfull commit message
- Make the Pull Request adding a good description of what you added
- That's all!

### Format off the added page

Every page should be listed following the next criteria:
- Page title: The title of the page
- Link off the page: the home page link
- Description: short description or slogan of the page

## Something else?

If you want to add some new feature or new things that are not pages, you should open an issue and tell us the new change you want to add.
